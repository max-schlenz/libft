# Libft Project

## Introduction
Libft is the first project of the 42 School curriculum, aiming to create a personal C library. It involves coding and recoding a set of functions that mimic the behavior of standard C library functions, along with some additional ones, to form a useful set of tools for future projects.

## Features
- **Libc Functions**: Reimplementation of several standard C library functions.
- **Additional Functions**: A set of functions that are either not present in the libc or presented in a different form.
- **List Functions**: Functions to manipulate linked lists (bonus).
- **Memory and String Manipulation**: Functions for efficient memory and string handling.
- **Added some additional functions myself to use in further projects.

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository:
2. Compile the library: `make`
3. Include `libft.h` in your C projects to use these functions.

## Technologies Used
- C programming language
- Usage of Libraries in C
- Makefile for compilation
